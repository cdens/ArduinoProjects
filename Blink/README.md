This is the "Hello World" for Arduino- blinking an LED. You can either watch the "13" or "L" built-in LED or connect a separate LED to the 13 (positive) and GND (ground) pins on the Arduino.

Requirements:
* Arduino Uno (or Sparkfun Redboard)
* Relevant USB cable for computer/power connection
* LED (optional)
