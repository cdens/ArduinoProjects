This repository contains selected basic intro Arduino projects (primarily from The Arduino Inventor's Guide, by Brian Huang and Derek Runberg). Some of the projects are just from the book, and some go a bit further because I wanted to try to accomplish specific things (trying to improve my C++ skills in addition to learning the ins and outs of Arduinos).

The items required for all of these projects are included in the Sparkfun Inventor's Kit (KIT-13969) and their supplementary kit (NoStarchArduino), and each project lists tools/electronics/etc required to replicate it.
